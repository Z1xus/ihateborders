A lightweight Windows utility that allows you to toggle window borders on/off for any application window, creating a borderless fullscreen experience.

### Why ihateborders?
This project was created as a free and open-source alternative to [Borderless Gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming) by Codeusa, which became a paid application on Steam and had all free release binaries removed from GitHub.

### Usage
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/z1xus/ihateborders/releases) page.
2. Run the executable.
3. Select a window from the dropdown list.
4. Optionally check "Resize to screen" to make the window fullscreen when removing borders.
5. Click "Make Borderless" or "Restore Borders" to toggle the window's border state.

### Interface
- **[B]** indicates a borderless window
- **[W]** indicates a windowed (with borders) window
- Windows are automatically filtered to exclude system windows
- The window list refreshes automatically every 5 seconds

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `F5`: Manually refresh the window list

```bash
